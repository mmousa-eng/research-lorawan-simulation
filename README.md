# üîç Research: LoRaWAN Building Penetration Simulation

This project simulates the signal reach of a LoRaWAN device placed on the rooftop of a 6-storey concrete building, estimating the received signal strength (RSSI) at each floor down to the basement.

Technologies: Python ‚Ä¢ Matplotlib ‚Ä¢ PyYAML ‚Ä¢ Signal Processing ‚Ä¢ LoRaWAN Simulation

## üìà Objective
Develop a configurable Python tool to model and visualize LoRaWAN signal propagation through concrete floors by calculating floor-wise RSSI and comparing it against receiver sensitivity thresholds.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Edit `config.yaml` to set simulation parameters.
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. View the generated RSSI plot.

## File Structure
