# 🔍 Research: LoRaWAN Building Penetration Simulation

This project simulates the signal reach of a LoRaWAN device placed on the rooftop of a 6-storey concrete building, estimating the received signal strength (RSSI) at each floor down to the basement.

Technologies: Python • Matplotlib • PyYAML • Signal Processing • LoRaWAN Simulation

## 📈 Objective
Model and visualize LoRaWAN signal strength through concrete floors with configurable parameters and sensitivity comparison.
