# 🔍 Research: LoRaWAN Building Penetration Simulation
 This LoRaWAN simulation was developed as part of a broader system used in my patented design for a smart water tank monitoring solution. It was used to assess signal reliability in multi-story buildings.

Technologies: Python • Matplotlib • PyYAML • Signal Processing • LoRaWAN

## 📈 Objective
Model and visualize LoRaWAN signal strength through concrete floors with configurable parameters and sensitivity comparison.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📊 Results
Simulation results show that the LoRaWAN signal can reliably penetrate up to two concrete floors in a typical multi-storey residential building.
